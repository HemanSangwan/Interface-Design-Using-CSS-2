        <p class="font1">I was the knight in shining armour in your movie
                Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste<br>
                Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
                You're the reason that I just can't concentrate<br>
                I, I've been trying to fix my pride
                But that shit's broken, ooh, that shit's broken<br>
                Ooh, lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
                But now you know it<br></p>
        <p class="font3">That I'm at an all time</p>
        <p class="font2">Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low<br>
                Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low<br>

        <p class="font1">I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
                An example of the perfect candidate<br>
                Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
                You're the reason that I just can't concentrate<br>
                I, I've been trying to fix my pride
                But that shit's broken, that shit's broken<br>
                Now I lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
